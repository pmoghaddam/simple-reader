## Overview / History
Simple Reader was developed during a weekend upon the news of Google Reader being decomissioned. Set with a task, and challenge of 48 hours, Simpler Reader was born. While aiming to match basic functionalities of Google Reader, it went beyond it by providing a Mobile First design that allowed mobile navigation which Google Reader lacked. The project was not maintained due to the excellent alternative of Feedly.

## Architecture
The codebase follows a basic Rails architecture with the addition of using Service objects and Query objects for modularization.
